I am continuously developing my skills in web development languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP by creating my personal website. On this site, I aim to showcase the projects I have worked on in a professional manner, allowing potential employers and business partners to see my skills and experience. Additionally, I intend to create a comprehensive CV front page that I can use in my career, further strengthening my professional profile.
